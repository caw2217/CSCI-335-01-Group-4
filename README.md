# CIFAR-10 Image Classification

by Cameron Wilson (caw2217) and Brandon Santore (bms1276)

## Abstract
The goal of this project is to evaluate three different models' performance on classifying the CIFAR-10 Dataset.

## Neural Network
NeuralNetwork.py is the neural network model. Currently, the file preprocesses the data and creates a simple neural network model with low accuracy.
